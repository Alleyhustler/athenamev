SpaceGodzilla used this shield both to protect himself and defend the Fukuoka Tower when Godzilla tried to attack it."

                        "SpaceGodzilla is able to fire an energy beam from his mouth and shoulder crystals called the Corona Beam (コロナビーム Korona Bīmu).[8][13] The beam is yellowish-orange in color and lightning-like in appearance with a bluish-white curved tip on the front end shaped like a dagger or scorpion's stinger to stab and dig into armored targets before exploding. He appears able to control the direction and movements of these energy beams, possibly through his telekinesis, allowing them to hit his target in various ways, even bypassing potential defenses. The beam is able to visibly injure Godzilla, even knocking him to the ground in one instance, and later is used to sever one of MOGUERA's arms. In Godzilla Island, SpaceGodzilla's beam attack appears more like a red-colored version of Godzilla's atomic breath."

Though he cannot move his targets with great speed, Godzilla was completely unable to break free of his psychic grip.

He is able to raise them up from the ground to use a means of defending himself or attacking his foes. He also appears able to form these crystals out of thin air as well, as he encases himself in a mass of crystals while in his flying form. SpaceGodzilla is also able to combine this power with his energy manipulation in order to use the crystals to attack his foes with energy beams and small crystal shards, as well as provide him with a source of energy and an increase in attack power. In the Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla manga adaptation, SpaceGodzilla spreads these crystals by exhaling a stream of crystalline spores"

He is able to conduct energy through touch, an ability referred to as Space Claw (スペース・クロー Supēsu Kurō),[8] allowing him to stand a better chance when facing a foe in close combat. He can absorb energy from nearby sources as well and combine this power with his geokinesis to maximize his energy as well as create giant crystal structures which he can throw at his foes. He also produces an aura that can cause electrical disturbances, as demonstrated against MOGUERA in their first fight. In Godzilla Island SpaceGodzilla's ghost form has the ability to absorb spiritual energy from other beings as well."

Their quantity makes them hard to dodge, though they travel at a slow pace. In the PlayStation 3 and 4 Godzilla game, SpaceGodzilla can create Homing Ghosts out of thin air, though only while the Crystal Field is present."
